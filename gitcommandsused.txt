#Let's export the copied URL in an environment variable so it's 
#available for us to use in the later steps, run the following command in terminal:

# A utiliser généralement dans un environnement linux
#1- export ORIGIN=<your repository HTTPS URL>
#2- git clone $ORIGIN
#3- git checkout -b branch_name: to create a new branch and switch to it
#4- git status: to see the current changes on your working directory
#5- git diff path_to_the_changed_file to see the made chnages
#6- git add . : to add all untracked files in the current directory and subdirectories to the staging area
# you can also use git add file_name: to add a single file you created to the staging area and finally
#git add -A: to recursively add all filses from the top levels git folder
6- to commit the new file to your local repository, you need to first tell git who you are: 
git config --global user.email "my_email"
git config --global user.name "my_name"
>> git add -A
7- git commit -m "message to commit"
8- to merge to the main branch
>> git checkout main : to ensure you're on the main branch
>> git merge name_of_created_branch
>>git log : to confirm the change was merged
>> git checkout main: to ensure that we're still on the main branch
>> git branch -d name_branch : to delete our created branch
>> git push origin main
>>git push --set-upstream origin branch_name: to push the changes you made above in the lab environmentor your local system IDE
to the branch_name branch in your Github repository, which is tracked as the upstream branch
